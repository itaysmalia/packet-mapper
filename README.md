# packet-mapper
full stack project to map your packets.
created by [@itaysmalia](https://github.com/itaysmalia).
I created this program so we all can see easily from where our network information comes from.

# usage:
Linux:
just run the run.sh script with root permitions:
```bash
$ sudo ./run.sh
```
Windows:
just run the batch file (You might need administrator privllage)
```ps
run.bat
```

Have fun!!
